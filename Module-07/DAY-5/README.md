# Ex.No:7(E)  Thread Synchronization with Object Lock

## AIM:
To compute the square of numbers in a synchronized block, ensuring thread safety during execution.
## ALGORITHM :

1. Define a `square` method that calculates the square of numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. Use a synchronized block (`synchronized(this)`) to ensure that only one thread can execute the code block at a time.
3. Within the synchronized block, compute and print the square of each number.
4. Introduce a delay using `Thread.sleep(400)` to simulate time-consuming computation.
5. Handle any potential exceptions caused by the sleep method.

                   System.out.println(e);
