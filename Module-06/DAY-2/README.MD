# Ex.No:6(B) MULTI-LEVEL INHERITANCE

## AIM:
To demonstrate constructor chaining in multilevel inheritance in Java.

## ALGORITHM :

1. Start with class `A` having a constructor that prints a message.
2. Class `B` extends `A` and its constructor prints its own message.
3. Class `C` extends `B` and also prints its message in its constructor.
4. In the `main` method of class `A`, create an object of class `C`.
5. When the object is created, constructors are called in order: `A → B → C` due to inheritance.

    public B(){
        System.out.println("Class B's display");
    }
}
class C extends B{
    public C(){
        System.out.println("Class C's display");
